        <p>
            Shan Moulder, is a third generation butcher from South Africa.  At the young age of 13 Shan already knew that he wanted to be a butcher and learn the great skills and specialised knowledge required.  He started at a young age helping in his dads shop (Alberton Meat Market which was established in 1979) on weekends and in school holidays, watching and learning from his dad and grandfather doing what they do best.  Shan brings along with him his grandfather’s boerewors and pork sausage recipe that originated in 1943, as well as making biltong the same way in which his grandfather taught him.  Both of these family recipes are a huge part of the success of his dad’s shop which is still going strong.
